<h1 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>Week 1 –
Day 1</strong></h1>
<p><strong>The Mingled Spirit</strong></p>
<hr/>

<p>In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, He
also created man. The Bible says, <em>“God created man in His own
image”</em> (Genesis 1:27). That is very important. To be made in
God’s image means we are not just like animals, trees, or stars. We
were created to reflect who God is.</p>
<p>Who is God’s image? The Bible tells us clearly that Christ—Jesus
Himself—is the image of God (2 Corinthians 4:4; Colossians 1:15).
So when God made man, He made us to match Christ.</p>
<p>But God did not only make us to look like Him. He made us for
something more. Romans 9:21 explains that God made us as <strong>vessels</strong>.
A vessel is like a cup or a bottle. Think about it: what is the
purpose of a cup? Not to do work by itself, but to <strong>hold
something</strong> inside. In the same way, you and I were not made
just to work hard for God. We were made to <strong>contain God inside
us</strong>.</p>
<p>Now let’s look closer. God gave us something very special—our
<strong>human spirit</strong>. In Genesis 2:7 we read that God formed
man’s body from the dust of the ground. Then God breathed into man
the breath of life, and man became a living soul. That breath was not
just air. It was God’s breath, and it became man’s spirit.</p>
<p>Job 32:8 says, <em>“There is a spirit in man, and the breath of
the Almighty gives them understanding.”</em> Proverbs 20:27 adds,
<em>“The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord.”</em> Together
these verses show us that man’s spirit is like a lamp inside of us,
lit by God’s own breath.</p>
<p>So man is made of three parts: body, soul, and spirit (1
Thessalonians 5:23). The body is our outside frame. The soul is our
personality—our mind, feelings, and will. But the deepest and most
important part is the <strong>spirit</strong>, where God’s life can
live.</p>
<p>Here’s an example: a radio looks nice on the outside, but if it
does not have a receiver inside, it cannot pick up any sound. Our
body is like the box of the radio, but our spirit is the receiver.
Without the receiver, the radio is silent. Without our spirit, we
cannot connect with God.</p>
<p>The prophet Zechariah said something amazing (Zechariah 12:1). He
said that God made three great things: the heavens, the earth, and
the spirit of man. The heavens are for the earth. The earth is for
man. And man’s spirit is for God. That is the purpose of the
universe. The heavens above us were made so the earth could exist.
The earth was made so that man could live. And man was made so that
God could live in man’s spirit.</p>
<p>This is why man is called a <strong>God-bottle</strong>. We are
empty without Him. Education, food, clothing, entertainment—these
things may fill our time, but they cannot fill our spirit. Only God
can fill our spirit. And since God is Spirit (John 4:24), only our
spirit can truly receive Him.</p>
<p>Without God, the universe feels empty. Without our spirit, life
has no meaning. But with God living in our spirit, suddenly life has
purpose, joy, and light.</p>
<hr/>

<p>✨ <strong>Lesson for Today</strong><br/>
You are not just dust.
You are not just body and soul. Inside you is a spirit, and that
spirit was made by God and for God. Your spirit is like a lamp
waiting for God’s light, and like a bottle waiting to be filled.
Only God can make your life truly full.</p>
<p>👉 Remember: You are a vessel for God. And your spirit is made
to receive His Spirit.</p>

Day 2</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Regenerated in Our Spirit</strong></p>
<hr/>

<p>📖 <strong>Scripture Reading</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p>John 3:6 – “That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.”</p></li>
	<li><p>John 4:24 – “God is Spirit, and those who worship Him
	must worship in spirit and truthfulness.”</p></li>
	<li><p>Romans 8:16 – “The Spirit Himself witnesses with our
	spirit that we are children of God.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<p>When a person sins, something inside becomes dark and dead. But
the good news is this: when a sinner repents, confesses, and believes
in Jesus, something wonderful happens. At that very moment, Christ
comes as the <strong>life-giving Spirit</strong> into the person’s
spirit. What was once dead is made alive. The Bible calls this being
<strong>regenerated</strong>—born again in the spirit.</p>
<p>Immediately, the person feels different. There is joy. There is
peace. A great change has taken place. This person is now a
Christian, no longer just living by the flesh, but living by God’s
Spirit inside.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>Two Spirits
Together</strong></h3>
<p>The Christian life is not possible by our effort alone. We need to
know two things:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>God is Spirit.</p></li>
	<li><p>We have a human spirit.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These two must come together. The Christian life is built on this
foundation: <strong>the Spirit with our spirit</strong>.</p>
<p>Look at John 3:6. Jesus said, <em>“That which is born of the
Spirit is spirit.”</em> The first “Spirit” means God’s
Spirit. The second “spirit” means our human spirit. Our human
spirit is born from God’s Spirit. This is not our first birth from
our parents; it is the second birth from God. This is why Christians
are sometimes called “born again people.” We are born first in
the flesh, but born again in the spirit.</p>
<p>John 4:24 continues: <em>“God is Spirit, and those who worship
Him must worship in spirit.”</em> Just as our body has organs—eyes
to see, ears to hear, a mouth to eat—so our spirit is an organ too.
It is the organ to worship God, to contact Him, to receive Him, and
even to “digest” Him like food.</p>
<p>Jesus said, <em>“I am the bread of life”</em> (John 6:35).
When we eat food, our stomach digests it. In the same way, our spirit
is like a <strong>spiritual stomach</strong>. It is made to take in
Christ as our living bread, to enjoy Him and be filled with Him.</p>
<p>Romans 8:16 tells us another secret: <em>“The Spirit Himself
witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.”</em> This
means the Spirit and our spirit are like two voices speaking
together. Sometimes we say in our heart, “God is my Father.” Then
God’s Spirit answers back, “Yes, you are My child.” Or
sometimes the Spirit says, “You are a child of God,” and our
spirit replies, “Amen! Hallelujah!”</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>The
Christian Life</strong></h3>
<p>These three verses—John 3:6, John 4:24, and Romans 8:16—show
us the whole Christian life:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>In John 3:6 → we are <strong>born again</strong> in our
	spirit.</p></li>
	<li><p>In John 4:24 → we <strong>worship and enjoy God</strong> in
	our spirit.</p></li>
	<li><p>In Romans 8:16 → we <strong>walk with God</strong>, knowing
	we are His children.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is not just a religion. It is a life—God’s Spirit joined
with our spirit, every day.</p>
<hr/>

<p>✨ <strong>Lesson for Today</strong><br/>
You are more than body
and soul. You have a spirit made alive by God’s Spirit. That spirit
is for worship, for joy, and for fellowship with your Father.</p>
<p>👉 Remember: You are a child of God. His Spirit and your spirit
speak together, giving you life and peace.</p>

<p><strong>The Lord’s Spirit – One with Our Spirit</strong></p>
<hr/>

<p>📖 <strong>Scripture Reading</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p>1 Corinthians 15:45 – “…The last Adam became a
	life-giving Spirit.”</p></li>
	<li><p>1 Corinthians 6:17 – “But he who is joined to the Lord is
	one spirit.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<p>When we believe in Jesus and are baptized into Him, something
amazing happens. Jesus comes into us, and we are placed into Him. He
lives in us, and we live in Him. How is this possible? The answer is
simple but powerful: <strong>the two spirits become one.</strong></p>
<p>The Lord is the divine Spirit, and we have a human spirit. When He
comes into us, His Spirit joins with our spirit. Inside, deep within,
there is now a union—<strong>we are one spirit with Him</strong>.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>Jesus, the
Life-Giving Spirit</strong></h3>
<p>The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 15:45 that Jesus, the last Adam,
became a <strong>life-giving Spirit</strong>. This means He is not
only the Savior who died for us on the cross, but now He is also the
Spirit who gives life inside of us.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 6:17 tells us, <em>“He who is joined to the Lord
is one spirit.”</em> This is not just a theory—it is a fact. Deep
inside you, the Spirit of God and your human spirit are mingled
together as one.</p>
<p>Paul confirmed this when he wrote to Timothy: <em>“The Lord be
with your spirit”</em> (2 Timothy 4:22). If the Lord were not
Spirit, He could not live in our spirit. But because He is Spirit, He
can be present with us in the deepest part of our being.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>Practicing
Being One Spirit with the Lord</strong></h3>
<p>The Christian life is not only about being forgiven of sins or
cleansed by the blood of Jesus—although that is wonderful. It is
more than just being redeemed or even being born again. The highest
Christian life is to live daily as <strong>one spirit with the Lord</strong>.</p>
<p>Think of electricity flowing through a wire. The power is there,
but if something blocks it—like insulation or a break—the current
cannot flow. In the same way, when we sin, it becomes like insulation
between us and God. But when we confess and repent, the barrier is
removed, and His Spirit flows freely in us again.</p>
<p>This shows us that the Christian life is not only about learning
doctrines, but about experiencing Christ as life every day.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>Calling on
the Lord from Our Spirit</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes we need to stop all the noise of our body and soul. We
need to call from deep inside: <em>“O Lord Jesus!”</em> When we
do this, His light shines within us.</p>
<p>Many people ask, “How can you be so strong, so full of energy,
even when you are older?” The answer is simple: <strong>I am one
spirit with the Lord.</strong></p>
<p>It is like a toy powered by electricity—the toy is active only
when it is connected to power. In the same way, when we are connected
to Christ’s Spirit, we are full of heavenly energy.</p>
<hr/>

<p>✨ <strong>Lesson for Today</strong><br/>
The Lord is not far
away. He is Spirit, and He is joined with your spirit. Every day, you
can live as one spirit with Him.</p>
<p>👉 Remember: The secret to strength, joy, and energy in the
Christian life is this: <strong>“He who is joined to the Lord is
one spirit.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Calling on the Name of the Lord</strong></p>
<hr/>

<p>📖 <strong>Scripture Reading</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Isaiah 12:4 – “Give thanks to Jehovah; call upon His
	name!”</p></li>
	<li><p>Romans 10:12 – “For the same Lord is Lord of all and rich
	to all who call upon Him.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<p>Every new day begins with a choice. Will we start in the
flesh—careless, distracted—or will we start in the spirit—full
of life? The best way to begin the day is simple: <strong>call on the
name of the Lord</strong>.</p>
<p>When we rise in the morning and say, <em>“O Lord Jesus!”</em>
we turn back to our spirit. Calling like this brings us into His
presence. But if we wake up and wander through the morning loosely,
the whole day may feel wasted.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>What Does It
Mean to Call?</strong></h3>
<p>Some people think calling on the Lord is just praying. Yes,
calling is prayer, but it is more than that. To “call” means to
cry out loud, to invoke a person by name. Prayer can be silent, but
calling must be <strong>audible</strong>.</p>
<p>The prophet Jeremiah described it as “breathing.” He said, <em>“I
called upon Your name, O Jehovah, from the lowest pit. You have heard
my voice; do not hide Your ear at my breathing, at my cry”</em>
(Lamentations 3:55–56).</p>
<p>Isaiah also spoke of calling: <em>“Give thanks to Jehovah; call
upon His name! Sing to Jehovah… Cry out and give a ringing shout,
for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel”</em> (Isaiah
12:4–6). To call on the Lord is to cry out, to sing, to shout, to
rejoice—it is our way of drawing living water from the wells of
salvation.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>The History
of Calling</strong></h3>
<p>Calling on God’s name is not new. It began long ago with Enosh,
the son of Seth (Genesis 4:26). Abraham built altars and called on
the Lord. Isaac, Moses, Job, Samuel, David, Jonah, Elijah—all
called on His name. The prophets even said that one day, <em>“Whoever
calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved”</em> (Joel 2:32).</p>
<p>In the New Testament, believers also called on Jesus’ name. On
the day of Pentecost, Peter declared that calling was the way of
salvation (Acts 2:21). When Stephen was stoned, he called on the Lord
(Acts 7:59). Early Christians were even known as “those who call on
the name of Jesus” (Acts 9:14; 1 Corinthians 1:2).</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>Calling
Today</strong></h3>
<p>Paul wrote in Romans 10:12–13: <em>“The same Lord is Lord of
all and rich to all who call upon Him; for whoever calls on the name
of the Lord shall be saved.”</em></p>
<p>This shows us something precious: the Lord is not poor or limited.
He is rich! And His riches are for everyone who calls upon Him.</p>
<p>Calling is not old-fashioned. It is for today. It is for every
believer, every day. It is a mark of God’s people. When we call, we
breathe Him in. When we call, we drink from His Spirit. When we call,
we enjoy His riches.</p>
<hr/>

<p>✨ <strong>Lesson for Today</strong><br/>
Start your day by
calling: <em>“O Lord Jesus!”</em> Call when you are weak. Call
when you are thankful. Call when you are alone or with others.</p>
<p>👉 Remember: The Lord is rich to all who call on Him. And
whoever calls on His name shall be saved.</p>

<p><strong>Why We Need to Call on the Name of the Lord</strong></p>
<hr/>

<p>📖 <strong>Scripture Reading</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Romans 10:13 – “Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord
	shall be saved.”</p></li>
	<li><p>Psalm 116:13 – “I will take up the cup of salvation and
	call upon the name of Jehovah.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<p>Why should we call on the name of the Lord? The Bible gives us
many reasons, and all of them show how much we need this practice.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>1. To Be
Saved</strong></h3>
<p>Romans 10:13 says it clearly: <em>“Whoever calls upon the name
of the Lord shall be saved.”</em> Prayer in silence is good, but
when we open our mouth and call out, we experience salvation more
richly and deeply.</p>
<p>Have you ever tried calling out loud: <em>“O Lord Jesus, save
me!”</em>? The more we call, the more we feel His life and His
presence.</p>
<p>Psalm 116:13 says, <em>“I will take up the cup of salvation and
call upon the name of Jehovah.”</em> In fact, this psalm mentions
calling on the Lord four times! (verses 2, 4, 13, 17).</p>
<p>Isaiah also encourages us to call and even to shout: <em>“Call
upon His name! Cry out and give a ringing shout!”</em> (Isaiah
12:4, 6). Calling, crying, and even shouting bring release from our
self and fill us with God’s life.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>2. To Be
Rescued from Trouble</strong></h3>
<p>Life is not always easy. There are times of distress, pain,
sorrow, or sickness. Psalms tells us that calling on the Lord rescues
us from trouble (Psalm 18:6; 50:15; 86:7; 118:5; 116:3–4).</p>
<p>Sometimes people argue, “I don’t need to call.” But when
real trouble comes, they call out without thinking: <em>“O God,
help me!”</em> This shows that calling on the Lord is natural in
times of need.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>3. To
Receive the Spirit</strong></h3>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, Peter declared: <em>“Whoever calls on
the name of the Lord shall be saved”</em> (Acts 2:21). The Spirit
had already been poured out. Now the way to receive and enjoy Him is
to <strong>call on Jesus’ name</strong>.</p>
<p>The simplest way to be filled with the Holy Spirit is not by
trying harder, but by calling: <em>“O Lord Jesus!”</em></p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>4. To Eat
and Drink the Lord</strong></h3>
<p>Isaiah 55:1 says, <em>“Ho! Everyone who thirsts, come to the
waters… come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.”</em></p>
<p>But how do we eat and drink the Lord? Verse 6 gives the answer:
<em>“Seek Jehovah while He may be found; call upon Him while He is
near.”</em></p>
<p>Calling is the way to take Him in as our food and drink. It is how
our spirit is satisfied.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>5. To Enjoy
His Riches and Presence</strong></h3>
<p>Romans 10:12 says, <em>“The same Lord is Lord of all and rich to
all who call upon Him.”</em></p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is real, living, and always near. When you call His
name, He comes to you. Just like when you call the name of a friend
who is nearby, they answer. When we call <em>“Lord Jesus!”</em>
He answers with His riches.</p>
<p>You can call while driving, while working, while resting. Anytime,
anywhere, He is available.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>6. To Stir
Ourselves Up</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes we feel low, tired, or spiritually dry. Isaiah 64:7
says, <em>“There is no one who calls upon Your name, who stirs
himself up to lay hold of You.”</em></p>
<p>When you call on the Lord, you stir your heart, you lift your
spirit, and you regain strength.</p>
<hr/>

<p>✨ <strong>Lesson for Today</strong><br/>
Calling is not small.
It is salvation, rescue, strength, food, drink, joy, and riches.</p>
<p>👉 Remember: Wherever you are, open your mouth and call: <strong>“O
Lord Jesus!”</strong></p>
<hr/>

<h1 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>Week 1 –
Day 6</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Calling on the Lord – Pure, Daily, and Lifelong</strong></p>
<hr/>

<p>📖 <strong>Scripture Reading</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p>1 Corinthians 12:13 – “In one Spirit we were all baptized
	into one Body… and were all given to drink one Spirit.”</p></li>
	<li><p>1 Corinthians 12:3 – “…No one can say, ‘Jesus is
	Lord!’ except in the Holy Spirit.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<p>How should we call on the Lord? The Bible gives us clear answers.
It shows us that calling on the Lord is not just once, but every day,
for our whole life, and always from a pure heart.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>1. Call with
a Pure Heart and Lips</strong></h3>
<p>2 Timothy 2:22 says: <em>“Pursue righteousness, faith, love,
peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.”</em></p>
<p>This means when we call, our heart should be simple—wanting
nothing more than the Lord Himself. If our heart is full of selfish
desires, it is hard to touch Him.</p>
<p>Zephaniah 3:9 also says God will give His people <strong>purified
lips</strong>. Sometimes our lips are not pure because of careless or
negative words. If our lips are unclean, it can be hard to call
freely. But when we keep our words clean, our calling becomes fresh
and living.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>2. Call
Together and Daily</strong></h3>
<p>Calling is not only for private prayer. It is also something we do
together with other believers. That’s why Paul said to Timothy,
“with those who call on the Lord” (2 Tim. 2:22).</p>
<p>Psalm 88:9 says, <em>“I have called to You every day.”</em>
Psalm 116:2 adds, <em>“I will call upon Him all my days.”</em></p>
<p>This shows us:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>We should call daily.</p></li>
	<li><p>We should call for as long as we live.</p></li>
	<li><p>We should call together with others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Calling on the Lord is not a one-time action. It is a lifelong
practice.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>3. Calling
is Breathing</strong></h3>
<p>The prophet Jeremiah once prayed from a very low place, saying: <em>“I
called upon Your name, O Jehovah, from the lowest pit. You heard my
voice; do not hide Your ear at my breathing, at my cry”</em>
(Lamentations 3:55–56).</p>
<p>Do you see? Jeremiah compared calling to <strong>breathing</strong>.
When you are in the lowest pit—when life feels dark and heavy—don’t
complain or murmur. Just breathe out: <em>“O Lord Jesus.”</em></p>
<p>Even when people or problems push us down, one call can lift us up
to God’s presence, like breathing in fresh air after being stuck in
a small room.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>4. Drinking
the Spirit by Calling</strong></h3>
<p>1 Corinthians 12:13 says, <em>“We were all given to drink one
Spirit.”</em> How do we drink this Spirit? Verse 3 gives the
answer: <em>“No one can say, ‘Jesus is Lord!’ except in the
Holy Spirit.”</em></p>
<p>It’s simple. To say, <em>“Lord Jesus”</em> is to drink. Just
like breathing air brings life into our body, calling on the Lord
brings the Spirit into our spirit.</p>
<p>This is why an old hymn says:</p>
<p><em>“Just to breathe the Name of Jesus,<br/>
Is to drink of Life
indeed.”</em></p>
<p>To breathe is to drink. To call is to receive the living water of
the Spirit.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>5. A Calling
Life</strong></h3>
<p>Whenever you are thirsty, tired, or dry, call on the Lord. Whether
driving, working, or walking, calling always works.</p>
<p>This is not a heavy duty. It is the simplest, sweetest way to live
the Christian life. Our Christian life is a <strong>calling
life</strong>—breathing, drinking, and enjoying Jesus every day.</p>
<hr/>

<p>✨ <strong>Lesson for Today</strong><br/>
To call on the Lord is
to breathe Him, drink Him, and enjoy Him. Do it daily, together with
others, with a pure heart, and all your life long.</p>
<p>👉 Remember: Our life with Christ is not silent—it is full of
joyful calling: <strong>“O Lord Jesus!”</strong></p>

<h1 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>Week 1 –
Day 7</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Refresher – The Mingled Spirit and Calling on His Name</strong></p>
<hr/>

<p>📖 <strong>Scripture Reading</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Romans 10:13 – “Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord
	shall be saved.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<p>The first week is almost done. We have learned many things about
our spirit, about God’s Spirit, and about the simple but powerful
practice of calling on the Lord’s name. Day 7 is our chance to
pause, review, and let the lessons sink deep into our hearts.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>1. Created
With a Spirit</strong></h3>
<p>On Day 1 we saw that man is not just body and soul, but spirit
also. God made us like vessels, like bottles, to contain Him. Without
God, we are empty. With God’s Spirit in our spirit, life becomes
full of meaning.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>2. Born
Again in Our Spirit</strong></h3>
<p>On Day 2 we learned that when we repent and believe in Jesus, the
Spirit of God gives life to our spirit. This is being born again. Our
spirit is alive, able to worship, enjoy, and walk with God.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>3. One
Spirit With the Lord</strong></h3>
<p>Day 3 showed us that Jesus became the life-giving Spirit. When we
are joined to Him, His Spirit and our spirit are mingled together. We
are one spirit with the Lord. This is the highest Christian life.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>4. Begin the
Day by Calling</strong></h3>
<p>On Day 4 we discovered the secret of starting our day: call on His
name. <em>“O Lord Jesus!”</em> Calling is not silent—it is
audible, joyful, and full of life.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>5. Why We
Call</strong></h3>
<p>Day 5 explained the reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>To be saved.</p></li>
	<li><p>To be rescued from trouble.</p></li>
	<li><p>To receive the Spirit.</p></li>
	<li><p>To eat and drink spiritual life.</p></li>
	<li><p>To enjoy His riches.</p></li>
	<li><p>To stir ourselves up.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>6. How We
Call</strong></h3>
<p>On Day 6 we learned the way:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>With a pure heart.</p></li>
	<li><p>With purified lips.</p></li>
	<li><p>Daily and all our days.</p></li>
	<li><p>Together with other believers.</p></li>
	<li><p>By breathing and drinking the Spirit through calling: <em>“O
	Lord Jesus!”</em></p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><strong>7. The Whole
Week in One Picture</strong></h3>
<p>Think of it like this:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>God made us as vessels (cups).</p></li>
	<li><p>He breathed His Spirit into us (living water).</p></li>
	<li><p>Jesus became the life-giving Spirit (the water source).</p></li>
	<li><p>Our spirit is the receiver (the cup).</p></li>
	<li><p>Calling on His name is how we drink and fill up every day.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Without drinking, we become dry. With calling, we become
refreshed, joyful, and full of life.</p>
<hr/>

<p>✨ <strong>Lesson for Today</strong><br/>
The secret of the
Christian life is not complicated. It is as simple as breathing, as
natural as drinking: <strong>Call on the name of the Lord.</strong></p>
<p>👉 Remember: “Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be
saved” (Rom. 10:13).</p>
<hr/>

<p>🙏 <strong>Closing for Week 1</strong><br/>
Take a deep breath
and say it now: <strong>“O Lord Jesus!”</strong><br/>
This call
is the beginning of joy, the breath of life, and the way to live one
spirit with God.</p>
