  <sect1><title>Week 1 – Day 1</title>Week 1 – Day 1<para>The Mingled Spirit</para><para/><para>In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, He also created man. The Bible says, <emphasis>“God created man in His own image”</emphasis> (Genesis 1:27). That is very important. To be made in God’s image means we are not just like animals, trees, or stars. We were created to reflect who God is.</para><para>Who is God’s image? The Bible tells us clearly that Christ—Jesus Himself—is the image of God (2 Corinthians 4:4; Colossians 1:15). So when God made man, He made us to match Christ.</para><para>But God did not only make us to look like Him. He made us for something more. Romans 9:21 explains that God made us as vessels. A vessel is like a cup or a bottle. Think about it: what is the purpose of a cup? Not to do work by itself, but to hold something inside. In the same way, you and I were not made just to work hard for God. We were made to contain God inside us.</para><para>Now let’s look closer. God gave us something very special—our human spirit. In Genesis 2:7 we read that God formed man’s body from the dust of the ground. Then God breathed into man the breath of life, and man became a living soul. That breath was not just air. It was God’s breath, and it became man’s spirit.</para><para>Job 32:8 says, <emphasis>“There is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.”</emphasis> Proverbs 20:27 adds, <emphasis>“The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord.”</emphasis> Together these verses show us that man’s spirit is like a lamp inside of us, lit by God’s own breath.</para><para>So man is made of three parts: body, soul, and spirit (1 Thessalonians 5:23). The body is our outside frame. The soul is our personality—our mind, feelings, and will. But the deepest and most important part is the spirit, where God’s life can live.</para><para>Here’s an example: a radio looks nice on the outside, but if it does not have a receiver inside, it cannot pick up any sound. Our body is like the box of the radio, but our spirit is the receiver. Without the receiver, the radio is silent. Without our spirit, we cannot connect with God.</para><para>The prophet Zechariah said something amazing (Zechariah 12:1). He said that God made three great things: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man. The heavens are for the earth. The earth is for man. And man’s spirit is for God. That is the purpose of the universe. The heavens above us were made so the earth could exist. The earth was made so that man could live. And man was made so that God could live in man’s spirit.</para><para>This is why man is called a God-bottle. We are empty without Him. Education, food, clothing, entertainment—these things may fill our time, but they cannot fill our spirit. Only God can fill our spirit. And since God is Spirit (John 4:24), only our spirit can truly receive Him.</para><para>Without God, the universe feels empty. Without our spirit, life has no meaning. But with God living in our spirit, suddenly life has purpose, joy, and light.</para><para/><para>✨ Lesson for TodayYou are not just dust. You are not just body and soul. Inside you is a spirit, and that spirit was made by God and for God. Your spirit is like a lamp waiting for God’s light, and like a bottle waiting to be filled. Only God can make your life truly full.</para><para>👉 Remember: You are a vessel for God. And your spirit is made to receive His Spirit.</para><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/></sect1>

But the good news is this: when a sinner repents, confesses, and believes in Jesus, something wonderful happens. At that very moment, Christ comes as the life-giving Spirit into the person’s spirit. What was once dead is made alive. The Bible calls this being regenerated—born again in the spirit.</para><para>Immediately, the person feels different. There is joy. There is peace. A great change has taken place. This person is now a Christian, no longer just living by the flesh, but living by God’s Spirit inside.</para><para/><sect2><title>Two Spirits Together</title>Two Spirits Together<para>The Christian life is not possible by our effort alone. We need to know two things:</para><orderedlist><listitem><para>God is Spirit.</para></listitem><listitem><para>We have a human spirit.</para></listitem></orderedlist><para>These two must come together. The Christian life is built on this foundation: the Spirit with our spirit.</para><para>Look at John 3:6. Jesus said, <emphasis>“That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.”</emphasis> The first “Spirit” means God’s Spirit. The second “spirit” means our human spirit. Our human spirit is born from God’s Spirit. This is not our first birth from our parents; it is the second birth from God. This is why Christians are sometimes called “born again people.” We are born first in the flesh, but born again in the spirit.</para><para>John 4:24 continues: <emphasis>“God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit.”</emphasis> Just as our body has organs—eyes to see, ears to hear, a mouth to eat—so our spirit is an organ too. It is the organ to worship God, to contact Him, to receive Him, and even to “digest” Him like food.</para><para>Jesus said, <emphasis>“I am the bread of life”</emphasis> (John 6:35). When we eat food, our stomach digests it. In the same way, our spirit is like a spiritual stomach. It is made to take in Christ as our living bread, to enjoy Him and be filled with Him.</para><para>Romans 8:16 tells us another secret: <emphasis>“The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.”</emphasis> This means the Spirit and our spirit are like two voices speaking together. Sometimes we say in our heart, “God is my Father.” Then God’s Spirit answers back, “Yes, you are My child.” Or sometimes the Spirit says, “You are a child of God,” and our spirit replies, “Amen! Hallelujah!”</para><para/></sect2><sect2><title>The Christian Life</title>The Christian Life<para>These three verses—John 3:6, John 4:24, and Romans 8:16—show us the whole Christian life:</para><orderedlist><listitem><para>In John 3:6 → we are born again in our spirit.</para></listitem><listitem><para>In John 4:24 → we worship and enjoy God in our spirit.</para></listitem><listitem><para>In Romans 8:16 → we walk with God, knowing we are His children.</para></listitem></orderedlist><para>This is not just a religion.

Jesus comes into us, and we are placed into Him. He lives in us, and we live in Him. How is this possible? The answer is simple but powerful: the two spirits become one.</para><para>The Lord is the divine Spirit, and we have a human spirit. When He comes into us, His Spirit joins with our spirit. Inside, deep within, there is now a union—we are one spirit with Him.</para><para/><sect2><title>Jesus, the Life-Giving Spirit</title>Jesus, the Life-Giving Spirit<para>The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 15:45 that Jesus, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit. This means He is not only the Savior who died for us on the cross, but now He is also the Spirit who gives life inside of us.</para><para>1 Corinthians 6:17 tells us, <emphasis>“He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.”</emphasis> This is not just a theory—it is a fact. Deep inside you, the Spirit of God and your human spirit are mingled together as one.</para><para>Paul confirmed this when he wrote to Timothy: <emphasis>“The Lord be with your spirit”</emphasis> (2 Timothy 4:22). If the Lord were not Spirit, He could not live in our spirit. But because He is Spirit, He can be present with us in the deepest part of our being.</para><para/></sect2><sect2><title>Practicing Being One Spirit with the Lord</title>Practicing Being One Spirit with the Lord<para>The Christian life is not only about being forgiven of sins or cleansed by the blood of Jesus—although that is wonderful. It is more than just being redeemed or even being born again. The highest Christian life is to live daily as one spirit with the Lord.</para><para>Think of electricity flowing through a wire. The power is there, but if something blocks it—like insulation or a break—the current cannot flow. In the same way, when we sin, it becomes like insulation between us and God. But when we confess and repent, the barrier is removed, and His Spirit flows freely in us again.</para><para>This shows us that the Christian life is not only about learning doctrines, but about experiencing Christ as life every day.</para><para/></sect2><sect2><title>Calling on the Lord from Our Spirit</title>Calling on the Lord from Our Spirit<para>Sometimes we need to stop all the noise of our body and soul. We need to call from deep inside: <emphasis>“O Lord Jesus!”</emphasis> When we do this, His light shines within us.</para><para>Many people ask, “How can you be so strong, so full of energy, even when you are older?” The answer is simple: I am one spirit with the Lord.</para><para>It is like a toy powered by electricity—the toy is active only when it is connected to power. In the same way, when we are connected to Christ’s Spirit, we are full of heavenly energy.</para><para/><para>✨ Lesson for TodayThe Lord is not far away. He is Spirit, and He is joined with your spirit. Every day, you can live as one spirit with Him.</para><para>👉 Remember: The secret to strength, joy, and energy in the Christian life is this: “He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.”</para><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/><para/></sect2></sect1>

Will we start in the flesh—careless, distracted—or will we start in the spirit—full of life? The best way to begin the day is simple: call on the name of the Lord.</para><para>When we rise in the morning and say, <emphasis>“O Lord Jesus!”</emphasis> we turn back to our spirit. Calling like this brings us into His presence. But if we wake up and wander through the morning loosely, the whole day may feel wasted.</para><para/><sect2><title>What Does It Mean to Call?</title>What Does It Mean to Call?<para>Some people think calling on the Lord is just praying. Yes, calling is prayer, but it is more than that. To “call” means to cry out loud, to invoke a person by name. Prayer can be silent, but calling must be audible.</para><para>The prophet Jeremiah described it as “breathing.” He said, <emphasis>“I called upon Your name, O Jehovah, from the lowest pit. You have heard my voice; do not hide Your ear at my breathing, at my cry”</emphasis> (Lamentations 3:55–56).</para><para>Isaiah also spoke of calling: <emphasis>“Give thanks to Jehovah; call upon His name! Sing to Jehovah… Cry out and give a ringing shout, for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel”</emphasis> (Isaiah 12:4–6). To call on the Lord is to cry out, to sing, to shout, to rejoice—it is our way of drawing living water from the wells of salvation.</para><para/></sect2><sect2><title>The History of Calling</title>The History of Calling<para>Calling on God’s name is not new. It began long ago with Enosh, the son of Seth (Genesis 4:26). Abraham built altars and called on the Lord. Isaac, Moses, Job, Samuel, David, Jonah, Elijah—all called on His name. The prophets even said that one day, <emphasis>“Whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved”</emphasis> (Joel 2:32).</para><para>In the New Testament, believers also called on Jesus’ name. On the day of Pentecost, Peter declared that calling was the way of salvation (Acts 2:21). When Stephen was stoned, he called on the Lord (Acts 7:59). Early Christians were even known as “those who call on the name of Jesus” (Acts 9:14; 1 Corinthians 1:2).</para><para/></sect2><sect2><title>Calling Today</title>Calling Today<para>Paul wrote in Romans 10:12–13: <emphasis>“The same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him; for whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”</emphasis></para><para>This shows us something precious: the Lord is not poor or limited. He is rich! And His riches are for everyone who calls upon Him.</para><para>Calling is not old-fashioned. It is for today. It is for every believer, every day. It is a mark of God’s people. When we call, we breathe Him in. When we call, we drink from His Spirit. When we call, we enjoy His riches.</para><para/><para>✨ Lesson for TodayStart your day by calling: <emphasis>“O Lord Jesus!”</emphasis> Call when you are weak. Call when you are thankful. Call when you are alone or with others.</para><para>👉 Remember: The Lord is rich to all who call on Him.

The Bible gives us many reasons, and all of them show how much we need this practice.</para><para/><sect2><title>1. To Be Saved</title>1. To Be Saved<para>Romans 10:13 says it clearly: <emphasis>“Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”</emphasis> Prayer in silence is good, but when we open our mouth and call out, we experience salvation more richly and deeply.</para><para>Have you ever tried calling out loud: <emphasis>“O Lord Jesus, save me!”</emphasis>? The more we call, the more we feel His life and His presence.</para><para>Psalm 116:13 says, <emphasis>“I will take up the cup of salvation and call upon the name of Jehovah.”</emphasis> In fact, this psalm mentions calling on the Lord four times! (verses 2, 4, 13, 17).</para><para>Isaiah also encourages us to call and even to shout: <emphasis>“Call upon His name! Cry out and give a ringing shout!”</emphasis> (Isaiah 12:4, 6). Calling, crying, and even shouting bring release from our self and fill us with God’s life.</para><para/></sect2><sect2><title>2. To Be Rescued from Trouble</title>2. To Be Rescued from Trouble<para>Life is not always easy. There are times of distress, pain, sorrow, or sickness. Psalms tells us that calling on the Lord rescues us from trouble (Psalm 18:6; 50:15; 86:7; 118:5; 116:3–4).</para><para>Sometimes people argue, “I don’t need to call.” But when real trouble comes, they call out without thinking: <emphasis>“O God, help me!”</emphasis> This shows that calling on the Lord is natural in times of need.</para><para/></sect2><sect2><title>3. To Receive the Spirit</title>3. To Receive the Spirit<para>On the day of Pentecost, Peter declared: <emphasis>“Whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved”</emphasis> (Acts 2:21). The Spirit had already been poured out. Now the way to receive and enjoy Him is to call on Jesus’ name.</para><para>The simplest way to be filled with the Holy Spirit is not by trying harder, but by calling: <emphasis>“O Lord Jesus!”</emphasis></para><para/></sect2><sect2><title>4. To Eat and Drink the Lord</title>4. To Eat and Drink the Lord<para>Isaiah 55:1 says, <emphasis>“Ho! Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters… come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.”</emphasis></para><para>But how do we eat and drink the Lord? Verse 6 gives the answer: <emphasis>“Seek Jehovah while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near.”</emphasis></para><para>Calling is the way to take Him in as our food and drink. It is how our spirit is satisfied.</para><para/></sect2><sect2><title>5. To Enjoy His Riches and Presence</title>5. To Enjoy His Riches and Presence<para>Romans 10:12 says, <emphasis>“The same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him.”</emphasis></para><para>The Lord Jesus is real, living, and always near. When you call His name, He comes to you. Just like when you call the name of a friend who is nearby, they answer.

Anytime, anywhere, He is available.</para><para/></sect2><sect2><title>6. To Stir Ourselves Up</title>6. To Stir Ourselves Up<para>Sometimes we feel low, tired, or spiritually dry. Isaiah 64:7 says, <emphasis>“There is no one who calls upon Your name, who stirs himself up to lay hold of You.”</emphasis></para><para>When you call on the Lord, you stir your heart, you lift your spirit, and you regain strength.</para><para/><para>✨ Lesson for TodayCalling is not small.

Call with a Pure Heart and Lips<para>2 Timothy 2:22 says: <emphasis>“Pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.”</emphasis></para><para>This means when we call, our heart should be simple—wanting nothing more than the Lord Himself. If our heart is full of selfish desires, it is hard to touch Him.</para><para>Zephaniah 3:9 also says God will give His people purified lips. Sometimes our lips are not pure because of careless or negative words. If our lips are unclean, it can be hard to call freely. But when we keep our words clean, our calling becomes fresh and living.</para><para/></sect2><sect2><title>2. Call Together and Daily</title>2. Call Together and Daily<para>Calling is not only for private prayer. It is also something we do together with other believers. That’s why Paul said to Timothy, “with those who call on the Lord” (2 Tim. 2:22).</para><para>Psalm 88:9 says, <emphasis>“I have called to You every day.”</emphasis> Psalm 116:2 adds, <emphasis>“I will call upon Him all my days.”</emphasis></para><para>This shows us:</para><orderedlist><listitem><para>We should call daily.</para></listitem><listitem><para>We should call for as long as we live.</para></listitem><listitem><para>We should call together with others.</para></listitem></orderedlist><para>Calling on the Lord is not a one-time action.
