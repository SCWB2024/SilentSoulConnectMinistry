Week 2 – The Security and Assurance of Salvation</h1>
<p><strong>Day 1 – Knowing That You Are Saved</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scripture Reading</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p><em>Acts 16:31</em> — “Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you
	shall be saved…”</p></li>
	<li><p><em>John 1:12–13</em> — “But as many as received Him,
	to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those
	who believe in His name, who were born…of God.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">The Story</h3>
<p>One night in the city of Philippi, a jailer was terrified. An
earthquake shook the prison, the doors opened, and he thought the
prisoners had escaped. Ready to end his life, he was stopped by Paul
who cried, <em>“Do yourself no harm, we are all here!”</em>
Trembling, the jailer asked, <em>“What must I do to be saved?”</em>
Paul answered simply: <em>“Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall
be saved.”</em></p>
<p>That answer is the same for us today. Many people wonder if
salvation is real or if it’s possible to know for sure. Some think
salvation is uncertain—that we’ll only know at the end of life.
Others think even if you are saved, you can lose it at any moment.
But the Bible is clear: salvation is not a matter of guessing or
waiting. It is something we can know and experience now, with full
confidence.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">What Happens When You Believe</h3>
<p>The Bible shows us that salvation is not delayed—it happens the
moment you believe. It is not “believe today and maybe you’ll be
saved later.” Instead, Acts 16:31 and Romans 10:10 teach that
salvation comes immediately with believing. The two are joined
together.</p>
<p>Here’s what happens in that moment:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>You are forgiven</strong> of your sins (Acts 10:43).</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>You are washed</strong> and made clean (1 Corinthians
	6:11).</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>You are justified</strong>—declared righteous
	before God (Romans 5:1).</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>You are set free</strong> from judgment and curse
	(John 3:18; Galatians 3:13).</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>You are reconciled</strong>—brought back into
	relationship with God (Romans 5:10).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is called <em>redemption</em>. The price of sin was paid by
Jesus, and when you believe, His victory becomes yours.</p>
<p>But that is not all. At the same moment, you are also
<em>regenerated</em>—given new life. John 1:12–13 tells us that
those who believe are born of God and become His children. You
receive God’s eternal life, and with it, the promise that you will
never perish (John 3:16).</p>
<p>It’s like stepping from one world to another: John 5:24 says the
believer has passed from death into life. No longer condemned, no
longer waiting for judgment—you are alive in Christ now.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">Assurance, Not Guesswork</h3>
<p>Maybe you have asked yourself, <em>“Am I really saved? Did
something truly happen when I believed?”</em> These doubts are
common, especially for new believers. But God has not left us to
wonder.</p>
<p>Listen to His promise in <em>1 John 5:13</em>:<br/>
<em>“I have
written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of
God, that you may know you have eternal life.”</em></p>
<p>Notice—it doesn’t say “that you may feel” or “that you
may hope.” It says, <em>“that you may know.”</em> Your
assurance is not built on your feelings, which change, but on God’s
unchanging Word.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">Reflection</h3>
<p>Salvation is not a vague hope; it is a living reality. When you
believed in Jesus, you were forgiven, redeemed, born again, and given
eternal life. You stepped out of death and into life. You are now a
child of God, and you can know this with certainty—not because you
always feel it, but because God has written it.</p>

<p><strong>Day 2 – How Can I Be Sure?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scripture Reading</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p><em>1 John 5:13</em> — “I have written these things to
	you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe
	in the name of the Son of God.”</p></li>
	<li><p><em>Romans 8:16</em> — “The Spirit Himself witnesses with
	our spirit that we are children of God.”</p></li>
	<li><p><em>1 John 3:14</em> — “We know that we have passed out
	of death into life because we love the brothers. He who does not
	love abides in death.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">The Story</h3>
<p>Imagine a young believer named Daniel. He had just prayed to
receive Christ, but doubts crept in: <em>“What if I only imagined
it? How do I know I am really saved?”</em></p>
<p>He opened his Bible, and his eyes fell on 1 John 5:13. The words
leapt off the page: <em>“I have written these things to you…that
you may know that you have eternal life.”</em> Daniel realized
something: assurance doesn’t come from feelings but from God’s
Word, which is unchanging and cannot lie.</p>
<p>Like Daniel, every Christian may wonder at times, <em>“Am I
truly saved?”</em> The Bible gives us three strong proofs that
remove uncertainty.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">1. By the Word of God</h3>
<p>Our first assurance comes from what God has written. Unlike people
who may break promises, God’s Word never fails (Numbers 23:19;
Psalm 119:89). His promises are His will, signed and sealed for us.</p>
<p>What does He say?</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Whoever believes in Jesus is saved (John 3:16).</p></li>
	<li><p>Whoever confesses Him as Lord and believes God raised Him is
	saved (Romans 10:9).</p></li>
	<li><p>Whoever calls on His name will be saved (Romans 10:13).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have believed, confessed, and called on Him—then you are
saved. God says so. That settles it.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">2. By the Spirit’s Witness in Our Heart</h3>
<p>But God doesn’t just give us words on a page; He also confirms
them inside us. Romans 8:16 says the Spirit bears witness with our
spirit that we are children of God.</p>
<p>Think of how naturally a child calls his father “Daddy.” In
the same way, when we are born of God, we find ourselves saying
“Abba, Father” to Him—not as a forced act, but as something
sweet and natural. That inner warmth, that joy in prayer, is the
Spirit whispering, <em>“You are Mine.”</em></p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">3. By Our Love for Other Believers</h3>
<p>Finally, there is the proof of love. 1 John 3:14 says we know we
have passed from death to life because we love the brothers and
sisters in Christ. This love is not ordinary—it is divine.
Suddenly, you care deeply for people you may never have noticed
before. When you meet another believer, something inside says, <em>“This
is my family.”</em></p>
<p>This love is evidence of God’s life in you. By believing, you
receive eternal life. By loving, you see that life flowing out.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">Reflection</h3>
<p>Our assurance of salvation stands on three pillars:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>God’s <strong>unchanging Word</strong>—He promises you
	are saved.</p></li>
	<li><p>The <strong>Spirit’s witness</strong> within—reminding
	you that you belong to Him.</p></li>
	<li><p>The <strong>proof of love</strong>—your heart drawn to
	God’s people.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Together, these give us confidence that our salvation is real and
secure.</p>

<p><strong>Day 3 – The Security of Salvation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scripture Reading</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p><em>James 1:17</em> — “…The Father of lights, with whom
	there is no variation or shadow cast by turning.”</p></li>
	<li><p><em>Romans 11:29</em> — “For the gracious gifts and the
	calling of God are irrevocable.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">The Story</h3>
<p>A little girl once asked her father, <em>“Daddy, will you still
love me if I make a mistake?”</em> The father bent down, hugged
her, and said, <em>“My love will never change, no matter what you
do.”</em></p>
<p>That is a picture of our Heavenly Father. When God saves us, He
doesn’t do it halfway or with conditions. His salvation is eternal
and unshakable. Many people worry, <em>“What if I fail? What if I
fall short? Could God change His mind about me?”</em> The Bible
answers: No. Salvation is secure because it rests on God’s nature,
not our performance.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">1. Secured by God’s Unchanging Nature</h3>
<p>James 1:17 reminds us that unlike the sun, moon, or stars that
shift and cast shadows, God never changes. He is always the same. If
He has saved you, that salvation cannot be undone.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">2. Secured by God’s Unchanging Will</h3>
<p>Before the world began, God chose you and planned for you to be
His child (Ephesians 1:4–5, 11). Hebrews 6:17 says His counsel—His
will—does not change. What He planned, He will finish. You were
chosen, predestined, and called. That decision is eternal.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">3. Secured by God’s Unfailing Love</h3>
<p>1 John 4:10 says salvation didn’t begin with our love for God
but with His love for us. And Romans 8:39 says nothing can separate
us from that love—not death, not life, not any power in the
universe. His love is inseparable, and because His love is secure,
our salvation is secure.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">4. Secured by God’s Irrevocable Calling</h3>
<p>Romans 11:29 says God’s calling is irrevocable. He will not take
it back. When He calls you into His family, it is forever.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">5. Secured by God’s Justification</h3>
<p>On the cross, Jesus satisfied God’s righteousness once for all.
Because of this, God declares us righteous (Romans 3:26). Romans 8:33
asks, <em>“Who can bring any charge against God’s chosen ones?”</em>
The answer: no one. God Himself has justified us, and He cannot go
back on His Word.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">6. Secured by God’s Almighty Hand</h3>
<p>Jesus said in John 10:29, <em>“No one can snatch them out of My
Father’s hand.”</em> Imagine the strongest hand holding you
tight—you are safe. No enemy, no sin, no failure is stronger than
God’s grip.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">Reflection</h3>
<p>Your salvation rests on who God is, not on who you are. He is
unchanging, His will is unshakable, His love is inseparable, His
calling is irrevocable, His justification is unchallengeable, and His
hand is almighty. That means you can live with peace today: you are
safe in Him forever.</p>

<p><strong>Day 4 – Eternal Security in Christ</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scripture Reading</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p><em>John 10:28</em> — “And I give to them eternal life,
	and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch
	them out of My hand.”</p></li>
	<li><p><em>John 6:37</em> — “All that the Father gives Me will
	come to Me, and him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">The Story</h3>
<p>A shepherd once said of his sheep, <em>“When they are in my
arms, they are safe. Even if danger comes, I will protect them.”</em></p>
<p>Jesus, the Good Shepherd, says the same of us. When He gives
eternal life, it is not temporary, not fragile, not conditional. It
is His own life—God’s life. And that life keeps us secure
forever.</p>
<p>Many people struggle with fear: <em>“What if I slip? What if I
fail? Will Jesus cast me out?”</em> But listen to His words: <em>“I
give them eternal life…they shall never perish…and no one shall
snatch them out of My hand.”</em> The Son holds you, and the Father
holds you—two almighty hands guarding your soul.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">1. By God’s Eternal Life</h3>
<p>Eternal life is not just long life; it is God’s life, without
beginning or end. When Jesus gave you His life, He joined you to
Himself forever. That bond cannot be broken. You are now in an
eternal relationship with God—safe, secure, and unshakable.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">2. By God’s New Covenant</h3>
<p>God also sealed His promise through the <strong>new covenant</strong>
(Hebrews 8:8–12). This covenant was made with the blood of Jesus
(Matthew 26:28). It guarantees:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Forgiveness of sins—God remembers them no more.</p></li>
	<li><p>His law written on our hearts.</p></li>
	<li><p>A living relationship: “I will be their God, and they shall
	be My people.”</p></li>
	<li><p>Direct knowledge of Him.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This covenant is eternal (Hebrews 13:20). God does not break His
promises; He is faithful. His covenant ensures our salvation remains
secure.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">3. By Christ’s Perfect Redemption</h3>
<p>When Jesus died on the cross, He did not leave anything
unfinished. Hebrews 10:14 declares: <em>“By one offering He has
perfected forever those who are being sanctified.”</em> His
redemption is complete, eternal, and without flaw. That means no one
can undo it, no sin can overpower it, and no accusation can cancel it
(Romans 8:34).</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">4. By Christ’s Eternal Salvation</h3>
<p>Hebrews 5:9 says Christ became the source of <em>eternal
salvation</em>. His work on the cross is not bound by time—it
carries eternal power, eternal forgiveness, eternal cleansing. Once
received, it secures us forever.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">5. By Christ’s Almighty Hand</h3>
<p>The Son’s hand is as strong as the Father’s. Together they
guard our salvation. Nothing is stronger than God’s grip. Eternal
life never runs dry, and God never loses hold of His children.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">6. By Christ’s Unfailing Promise</h3>
<p>Finally, Jesus Himself promised: <em>“Whoever comes to Me I will
never cast out”</em> (John 6:37). That promise is unbreakable. If
you have come to Him, He will not let you go.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">Reflection</h3>
<p>From every angle—God’s life, God’s covenant, Christ’s
redemption, Christ’s salvation, His mighty hand, and His unshakable
promise—the message is clear: <strong>once saved, always saved</strong>.</p>
<p>You are not barely hanging on; you are held by God Himself.
Eternal life is not fragile—it is secure, complete, and forever.</p>

<p><strong>Day 5 – Salvation for the Whole Family</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scripture Reading</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p><em>Luke 19:9</em> — “And Jesus said to him, Today
	salvation has come to this house.”</p></li>
	<li><p><em>Acts 16:31</em> — “Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you
	shall be saved, you and your household.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">The Story</h3>
<p>Zacchaeus, the tax collector, climbed a tree to see Jesus. That
day, Jesus not only saved Zacchaeus but declared: <em>“Today
salvation has come to this house.”</em> Notice—Jesus didn’t
just say “to this man,” but <em>“to this house.”</em></p>
<p>Years later, in a Philippian jail, another family would hear this
truth. A jailer asked Paul and Silas, <em>“What must I do to be
saved?”</em> They answered, <em>“Believe on the Lord Jesus, and
you shall be saved—you and your household.”</em></p>
<p>God’s heart has always been for families. His salvation is
personal, but His unit of blessing is the household.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">God’s Pattern of Household Salvation</h3>
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>Noah and His Family</strong><br/>
When the flood
	came, God told Noah, <em>“Enter the ark, you and all your house”</em>
	(Genesis 7:1). Noah obeyed, and his whole family—his wife, sons,
	and daughters-in-law—were saved. This shows God’s desire to save
	households, not just individuals.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>The Families of Israel at Passover</strong><br/>
In
	Egypt, God commanded each family to take <em>a lamb for a house</em>
	(Exodus 12:3). The blood of that lamb saved every firstborn in the
	home. If one family was too small, they were to join their
	neighbor—another household. Again, the unit of salvation was the
	family.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Rahab and Her Household</strong><br/>
Rahab sheltered
	the spies in Jericho and begged for her family’s safety. She asked
	that her father, mother, brothers, and sisters be spared (Joshua
	2:12–13). When the city was destroyed, Joshua kept his promise:
	Rahab and her entire family were saved (Joshua 6:25).</p></li>
</ol>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">Reflection</h3>
<p>God cares about your whole family. His desire is not just for you
to believe, but for your household to experience His salvation. Just
as Noah’s family entered the ark, as Israel’s families were
covered by the lamb, and as Rahab’s family was spared from
judgment—so God’s promise reaches to our homes today.</p>
<p>When you believed in Christ, God invited you to pray for your
family and lead them to Him. His salvation is wide enough, strong
enough, and eternal enough for your whole household.</p>

<p><strong>Day 6 – Salvation for the Household (New Testament
Stories)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scripture Reading</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p><em>Luke 19:9</em> — “And Jesus said to him, Today
	salvation has come to this house.”</p></li>
	<li><p><em>Acts 11:14</em> — “You shall be saved, you and all
	your household.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">The Story</h3>
<p>When Zacchaeus came down from the sycamore tree, Jesus said:
<em>“Today salvation has come to this house.”</em> It was not
just Zacchaeus who was touched—it was his whole family. The
presence of Jesus in one life overflowed into an entire household.</p>
<p>This same pattern continues in the New Testament. God delights to
save not only individuals but families. His heart is big enough to
embrace households together.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">1. Zacchaeus the Tax Collector</h3>
<p>In Luke 19, Zacchaeus welcomed Jesus into his home. That day,
Jesus announced that salvation had come to <em>his house</em>. God’s
salvation was not for Zacchaeus alone but for everyone under his
roof.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">2. Cornelius the Centurion</h3>
<p>Cornelius was a Roman soldier, yet he feared God and prayed
earnestly. When Peter came to his house, Cornelius had already
gathered his relatives and close friends (Acts 10:24). As Peter
preached, the Holy Spirit fell on all who listened, and the whole
household was baptized (Acts 10:44, 48). Cornelius not only received
salvation but extended it to those closest to him.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">3. Lydia of Philippi</h3>
<p>Lydia, a businesswoman and worshiper of God, heard Paul’s
message by the riverside (Acts 16:14). The Lord opened her heart, and
she believed. Immediately, she and her whole household were baptized.
Once again, salvation touched an entire family.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">4. The Philippian Jailer</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most dramatic example is the Philippian jailer. After
the earthquake shook the prison, he cried out, <em>“What must I do
to be saved?”</em> Paul and Silas answered, <em>“Believe in the
Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household.”</em>
That very night, he washed their wounds, believed, and he and his
whole family were baptized together (Acts 16:32–33).</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">5. Other Families</h3>
<p>The New Testament records more households: the royal official’s
family in Cana (John 4:53), Crispus the synagogue ruler and his
household (Acts 18:8), and the household of Stephanas in Corinth (1
Corinthians 1:16). Each story confirms God’s heart: <strong>the
family is the unit of His salvation.</strong></p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">The Issue of Salvation</h3>
<p>Joshua, near the end of his life, declared to Israel: <em>“But
as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord”</em> (Joshua
24:15). That is the natural outcome of household salvation—families
not only saved but also united in serving God.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">Reflection</h3>
<p>Salvation is personal, but it is also communal. God’s desire is
not just to save you, but to save your family. Every time one person
believes, the door opens for the whole household. As Zacchaeus,
Cornelius, Lydia, and the jailer discovered, salvation is
contagious—it spreads from one heart to many.</p>
<p>May our declaration echo Joshua’s: <strong>“As for me and my
house, we will serve the Lord.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Day 7 – Review and Reflection</strong></p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">Recap of the Week</h3>
<p>This week we learned that salvation is not uncertain or fragile—it
is secure, eternal, and assured. Here are the key truths:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>Knowing You Are Saved (Day 1)</strong> – The moment
	you believe in Jesus, you are forgiven, redeemed, and born again.
	Assurance comes from God’s Word, not feelings.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Three Proofs of Assurance (Day 2)</strong> – We
	know we are saved by (1) God’s unchanging Word, (2) the Spirit’s
	witness in our hearts, and (3) our love for fellow believers.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>The Security of Salvation (Day 3)</strong> – Our
	salvation is secured by God Himself: His unchanging nature, will,
	love, calling, justification, and almighty hand.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Eternal Security in Christ (Day 4)</strong> –
	Christ Himself guarantees our salvation through His eternal life,
	His new covenant, His perfect redemption, His eternal salvation, His
	almighty hand, and His unfailing promise.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Salvation for Families – Part 1 (Day 5)</strong> –
	God’s plan includes households. From Noah to Israel to Rahab, God
	shows that His salvation is for families, not just individuals.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Salvation for Families – Part 2 (Day 6)</strong> –
	In the New Testament, Zacchaeus, Cornelius, Lydia, and the
	Philippian jailer all saw their whole households saved. God’s
	desire is: <em>“You and your household shall be saved.”</em></p></li>
	<li><p><strong>The Result of Salvation (Today)</strong> – Like
	Joshua declared, <em>“As for me and my house, we will serve the
	Lord”</em> (Joshua 24:15). Salvation leads not only to security
	but also to joyful service as a family.</p></li>
</ol>

take this week to share God’s salvation with your own family?</p>
<hr/>

<p>✅ <strong>Answers</strong> (check yourself):</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>False — Salvation happens immediately when we believe (Acts
	16:31).</p></li>
	<li><p>Witnesses — The Spirit witnesses with our spirit.</p></li>
	<li><p>c) Our own good works.</p></li>
	<li><p>Old Testament: Noah’s family, Israel at Passover, or
	Rahab’s family. New Testament: Zacchaeus, Cornelius, Lydia, or the
	Philippian jailer.</p></li>
	<li><p>(Personal reflection — answers will vary.)</p></li>
</ol>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">Closing Prayer</h3>
<p>“Lord Jesus, thank You for the eternal security of our
salvation. Thank You that we are safe in Your hands and nothing can
separate us from Your love. Help us to live with confidence, to love
others, and to lead our families to You. As for me and my house, we
will serve the Lord. Amen.”</p>
