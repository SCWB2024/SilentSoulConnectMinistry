WEEK 3 — THE WORD OF LIFE AND PRAY-READING THE WORD</h1>
<p><strong>Day 1 – The Word of Life</strong></p>
<p>📖 <strong>Scripture Reading:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p>John 1:1 — “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
	was with God, and the Word was God.”</p></li>
	<li><p>1 John 1:1 — “That which was from the
	beginning…concerning the Word of life.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">✋ Story Form</h2>
<p>Before the world began, there was the <strong>Word</strong>. The
Word was with God. The Word <em>was</em> God. That Word is <strong>Jesus</strong>.
He is called <em>the Word of Life</em> because He is alive and gives
eternal life.</p>
<p>The Bible is not like other books. Many people write books, but
only the Bible brings us Jesus Himself. Abraham Lincoln once said,
<em>“The Bible is the best gift God gave to man.”</em> Why?
Because it shows us the Savior. It has been translated into more
languages than any other book in the world. Truly, it is <strong>the
Book of Life</strong>.</p>
<p>The Bible is living because Jesus is living. He is:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The <strong>eternal Word</strong> (always existed).</p></li>
	<li><p>The <strong>living Word</strong> (gives life).</p></li>
	<li><p>The <strong>written Word</strong> (the Bible).</p></li>
	<li><p>The <strong>spoken Word</strong> (God speaking to you right
	now).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When we open the Bible, we should not only see letters on paper.
We should touch Jesus Himself.</p>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">🌱 Two Ways to Read the Bible</h2>
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>Outward Way (Mind Only):</strong><br/>
Two brothers
	read John 1:1. They argue:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li><p>“What does <em>in the beginning</em> mean?”</p></li>
	<li><p>“It means God is the beginning.”</p></li>
	<li><p>“No, I don’t think so…”<br/>
This is like looking at
	food in a picture. Nice to see, but it does not fill your stomach.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
	<li><p><strong>Inward Way (Spirit + Heart):</strong><br/>
The same
	brothers read and pray:<br/>
“O Lord, in the beginning…
	Hallelujah for the Word! The Word was with God! The Word was God!
	Amen!”<br/>
This is like eating real food—you are filled with
	life and strength.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This is called <strong>pray-reading</strong>: mixing prayer with
reading. Even if you don’t understand everything, your spirit
receives life.</p>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">👐 Sign Action (for Memory)</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Outward way: 🤔 confused face, head shake.</p></li>
	<li><p>Inward way: 🙌 open hands, joyful face.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">❤️ Lesson</h2>
<p>The Bible is alive because Jesus is alive. Don’t only use your
mind. Use your spirit. When you read, pray short words: “O Lord
Jesus!” The Word then becomes life in you.</p>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">📦 Summary Box</h2>
<p>👉 Bible = Life<br/>
👉 Jesus = Word<br/>
👉 Read with
Spirit</p>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">✍ Personal Reflection Questions</h2>
<ol>
	<li><p>When I read the Bible, do I only use my <strong>mind</strong>,
	or do I also open my <strong>heart</strong>?<br/>
<em>Write your
	answer.</em></p></li>
	<li><p>Write a short <strong>pray-reading prayer</strong> using
	today’s verses (John 1:1; 1 John 1:1). Example: “O Lord, in the
	beginning… Amen, the Word is life!”</p></li>

<h1 class="western">WEEK 3 — THE WORD OF LIFE AND PRAY-READING THE
WORD</h1>
<p><strong>Day 2 – Tasting the Lord in His Word</strong></p>
<p>📖 <strong>Scripture Reading:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p>1 Peter 2:2–3 — “As newborn babes, long for the pure
	milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation, if
	you have tasted that the Lord is good.”</p></li>
	<li><p>Matthew 4:4 — “Man shall not live on bread alone, but on
	every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">✋ Story Form</h2>
<p>When a baby is born, the first food is <strong>milk</strong>. The
baby does not study milk or ask, “What is milk made of?” The baby
simply drinks it, and it grows strong.</p>
<p>The Bible says we are like newborn babies. We must drink the <strong>milk
of the Word</strong> to grow in Jesus. Reading the Bible is not only
about <em>learning knowledge</em>. It is about <em>tasting</em> the
Lord.</p>
<p>Jeremiah said: <em>“Your words were found, and I ate them, and
they became joy and gladness in my heart”</em> (Jer. 15:16).
Ezekiel ate the Word in a vision (Ezek. 3:1–3). David said: <em>“How
sweet are Your words to my taste! Sweeter than honey!”</em> (Psa.
119:103).</p>
<p>When we eat food, it becomes part of us. In the same way, when we
“eat” God’s Word, it goes inside us and becomes joy, gladness,
and life.</p>
<p>Jesus also said: <em>“Man shall not live on bread alone, but on
every word from God”</em> (Matt. 4:4). Food keeps the body alive.
God’s Word keeps our spirit alive.</p>
<p>The Bible is not the <strong>tree of knowledge</strong> (only to
know right and wrong). It is the <strong>tree of life</strong> (to
give us God Himself). If we only read for knowledge, the Bible may
feel dry. But if we read to taste Jesus, it becomes sweet food that
fills us.</p>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">🌱 Example</h2>
<p>Reading the Bible only with the mind = like looking at bread in a
bakery window.<br/>
Reading with the spirit = like eating the bread
and being full.</p>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">👐 Sign Action (for Memory)</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Pretend drinking milk (🥛) → Word is milk.</p></li>
	<li><p>Pretend eating bread (🍞) → Word is food.</p></li>
	<li><p>Smile, hand on heart (❤️) → Word becomes joy inside.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">❤️ Lesson</h2>
<p>The Word of God is not only for learning. It is for <strong>tasting,
eating, and enjoying</strong>. Every time you open the Bible, think:
<em>“I am drinking milk. I am eating bread. I am tasting Jesus.”</em></p>
<hr/>

<h1 class="western">WEEK 3 — THE WORD OF LIFE AND PRAY-READING THE
WORD</h1>
<p><strong>Day 3 – Pray-Reading the Word</strong></p>
<p>📖 <strong>Scripture Reading:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Ephesians 6:17–18 — “…receive the word of God, by
	means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit…”</p></li>
	<li><p>John 6:63 — “It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh
	profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and
	are life.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">✋ Story Form</h2>
<p>When you pick up a Bible, remember—it is not like reading a
newspaper or schoolbook. It is God’s Word. To meet God in His Word,
we must prepare our hearts.</p>
<p>Before reading, we can pray:<br/>
“O Lord, forgive me. Cleanse
me with Your blood. Take away anything that blocks me from You. Make
me ready to receive Your Word.”</p>
<p>This is like washing your hands before eating. You prepare to
enjoy the food. When we confess and come clean before God, we are
ready for fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>Then we do not just <em>read</em> the Bible—we <strong>pray-read</strong>.
That means we mix prayer with the verses. Christians through the ages
have done this. Some prayed loudly, some softly. Some prayed quickly,
others slowly. Alone, with family, or in a group—it all counts as
pray-reading.</p>
<p>Paul teaches us to receive the Word of God “by means of all
prayer and petition.” We don’t need fancy words or long prayers.
We can pray exactly what we read. For example, if we read John 6:63,
we can pray:<br/>
“O Lord, Your words are spirit! Amen, they are
life to me!”</p>
<p>When words are just letters on paper, they are flat. But when we
pray them with our spirit, they become the Spirit and life. The Bible
turns into a living prayer book.</p>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">🌱 Example</h2>
<p>Reading only: like looking at water in a bottle.<br/>
Pray-reading:
like drinking the water and feeling refreshed.</p>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">👐 Sign Action (for Memory)</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Hands open like reading a book 📖.</p></li>
	<li><p>Then lift hands upward 🙌 (turning words into prayer).</p></li>
	<li><p>Pretend drinking water 💧 (Word becomes life).</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">❤️ Lesson</h2>
<p>Pray-reading is not about clever prayers. It is about letting
God’s Word enter your spirit. When you pray the verses, the words
become Spirit and life inside you.</p>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">📦 Summary Box</h2>
<p>👉 Prepare heart (confess + be clean)<br/>
👉 Read + Pray =

<ol>
	<li><p>Do I usually read the Bible like a <strong>book of letters</strong>,

<h1 class="western">WEEK 3 — THE WORD OF LIFE AND PRAY-READING THE
WORD</h1>
<p><strong>Day 4 – Breathing in the Word of Life</strong></p>
<p>📖 <strong>Scripture Reading:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p>2 Timothy 3:16 — “All Scripture is God-breathed…”</p></li>
	<li><p>John 5:39–40 — “You search the Scriptures, because you
	think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that
	testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that
	you may have life.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">✋ Story Form</h2>
<p>The Bible is not only words—it is <strong>God’s own breath</strong>.</p>
<p>Think of breathing:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>God breathes out His Word → the Bible.</p></li>
	<li><p>We breathe in His Word → prayer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If God breathes out but we never breathe in, we become weak. Many
people read the Bible like dead letters. But when we pray-read, we
are breathing God Himself into us. That Word becomes <em>spirit and
life</em> (John 6:63).</p>
<p>The Bible is also called our <strong>food</strong>. Jesus said, <em>“I
am the bread of life…he who eats Me shall live because of Me”</em>
(John 6:35, 57). Food on the table does nothing until we eat it. In
the same way, the Bible on the shelf does nothing until we “eat”
the Word by receiving it into our spirit.</p>
<p>But there is a warning. Jesus told the Jewish leaders: <em>“You
search the Scriptures…but you are not willing to come to Me”</em>
(John 5:39–40). They studied the Bible carefully, but they missed
the main point: <strong>the Bible leads us to Jesus</strong>. If we
only research the words but do not meet the Lord Himself, we get
knowledge but not life.</p>
<p>The Bible is not only a book—it is the <strong>embodiment of
Christ Himself</strong>. To touch the Word is to touch Jesus.</p>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">🌱 Example</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Reading without prayer → like smelling food but not eating.</p></li>
	<li><p>Pray-reading → like eating and digesting the food until it
	gives energy.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">👐 Sign Action (for Memory)</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Breathe out (💨) = God breathes His Word.</p></li>
	<li><p>Breathe in (😮‍💨) = we pray and receive.</p></li>
	<li><p>Pretend eating bread 🍞 = Word becomes life in us.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">❤️ Lesson</h2>
<p>The Bible is living breath, food, and the presence of Jesus
Himself. Whenever we open the Bible, we should also open our heart to
the Lord: “O Lord, I come to You through Your Word.”</p>

<h1 class="western">WEEK 3 — THE WORD OF LIFE AND PRAY-READING THE
WORD</h1>
<p><strong>Day 5 – Abiding in the Word, Catching Fire in the Spirit</strong></p>
<p>📖 <strong>Scripture Reading:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p>John 15:4, 7 — “Abide in Me and I in you.…If you abide
	in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall
	be done for you.”</p></li>
	<li><p>Colossians 3:16 — “Let the word of Christ dwell in you
	richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with
	psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your
	hearts to God.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">✋ Story Form</h2>
<p>Jesus says the way He lives (abides) in us is by His <strong>Word</strong>
living in us. When we take His Word into our heart, we take Jesus
Himself.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 explains: when the Word dwells in us, we will be
full of joy and songs. This is the same as being filled with the
Spirit. So—Word inside = Spirit inside.</p>
<p>Think about matches. A match has <strong>phosphorus</strong> on
the tip. When struck at the right place, it catches fire. But if you
strike it on the wrong place, nothing happens.</p>
<p>The Bible is like a match. Inside it is the Spirit and life (the
fire). But if we “strike” it only with our mind—studying
letters, analyzing, debating—it does not catch fire. If we strike
it with our <strong>spirit</strong>—pray-reading—it burns with
life.</p>
<p>When we pray-read, even a simple verse becomes fire. For
example:<br/>
“In the beginning… Hallelujah, the Word! The Word
was God!”<br/>
We may not understand everything, but the Spirit
burns inside us and fills us with life.</p>
<p>When the Word fills us, we naturally sing with grace in our
hearts. The Word in us becomes a song, a joy, and a fire.</p>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">🌱 Example</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Studying a match = no fire.</p></li>
	<li><p>Striking a match in the wrong place = still no fire.</p></li>
	<li><p>Striking it at the right spot = fire comes!<br/>
So also with
	the Bible: read with the spirit, not just the mind, and you catch
	the fire of life.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">👐 Sign Action (for Memory)</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Pretend holding a match, striking it 🔥.</p></li>

	<li><p>Hands open wide 🙌 singing with joy.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">❤️ Lesson</h2>
<p>The Bible is Christ Himself in Word form. If we let the Word live
in us, Christ abides in us, and our spirit will “catch fire.”
This fire brings singing, joy, and life.</p>

<h1 class="western">WEEK 3 — THE WORD OF LIFE AND PRAY-READING THE
WORD</h1>
<p><strong>Day 6 – Washed by the Word, Filled with the Spirit</strong></p>
<p>📖 <strong>Scripture Reading:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Ephesians 5:18 — “…Be filled in spirit.”</p></li>
	<li><p>Ephesians 5:25–26 — “Christ…loved the church and gave
	Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the
	washing of the water in the word.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">✋ Story Form</h2>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“Be filled in spirit.”</em> But how do we
get filled? The Spirit of God enters our spirit through the <strong>Word</strong>.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:26 explains that the Word washes us. This washing is
not outward like washing hands. It is an <strong>inward washing</strong>,
like living water flowing inside. This water is not the blood of
Christ. The blood washes away our sins. The water of life washes away
our spots, wrinkles, and old habits, changing us from the inside.</p>
<p>Think about a stream of water running over stones. At first the
stones are rough, but after years in the stream, they become smooth.
In the same way, the water of God’s Word softens, renews, and
transforms us.</p>
<p>When we read and pray-read the Bible, the Word becomes living
water that:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Clears away old, dark thoughts.</p></li>
	<li><p>Refreshes our spirit.</p></li>
	<li><p>Renews our inner being.</p></li>
	<li><p>Makes room for Christ to dwell inside us.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When this happens, we feel Christ is not far—He is living in us.
Our love for others grows, our spiritual eyes open, and our heart
becomes bright and clean.</p>
<p>This is not just an outward change (like putting on new clothes).
It is an <strong>inward life change</strong>—like the body growing
new, healthy cells. The Bible calls this a <strong>metabolic change</strong>:
a real transformation.</p>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">🌱 Example</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Soap cleans the <strong>outside</strong> of the body.</p></li>
	<li><p>Water of the Word cleans the <strong>inside</strong> of the
	spirit.</p></li>
	<li><p>Both are needed, but only the Word can refresh the heart and
	make it new.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">👐 Sign Action (for Memory)</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Pretend washing face 💦 (outward).</p></li>
	<li><p>Point to heart ❤️ with water flowing (inward).</p></li>
	<li><p>Open arms 🙌 saying “Amen” with joy.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">❤️ Lesson</h2>
<p>The Word is not just knowledge—it is <strong>living water</strong>
that washes, renews, and transforms us. When we pray-read and let the
Word flow freely inside, our spirit is filled, our eyes are opened,
and our heart is refreshed.</p>

	<li><p>What “spots or wrinkles” (old habits, wrong attitudes) do
	I feel God is washing away by His Word? Write them down.</p></li>

<h2 class="western">✋ Review of the Week</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Day 1</strong> – The Word of Life: The Bible is the
	living Word, not just letters. Reading with spirit brings life.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Day 2</strong> – Tasting the Word: God’s Word is
	milk, bread, and honey. We grow by “eating” it.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Day 3</strong> – Pray-Reading: Reading with prayer
	turns words into Spirit and life.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Day 4</strong> – Breathing the Word: The Bible is
	God’s breath. We breathe Him in through prayer.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Day 5</strong> – Abiding Word: When the Word lives
	in us, Christ abides in us. Pray-reading makes our spirit catch
	fire.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Day 6</strong> – Washing Word: The Word is living
	water, cleansing and transforming us inwardly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Bible is more than knowledge—it is life. Pray-reading,
tasting, breathing, and receiving the Word fills us with Christ
Himself.</p>
