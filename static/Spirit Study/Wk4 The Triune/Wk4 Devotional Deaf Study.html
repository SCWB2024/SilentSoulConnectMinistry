<strong>DAY 1 — God’s Person: Father, Son,
and Spirit</strong></p>

<h3 class="western">📖 Key Scriptures</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Matthew 28:19 (NLV):</strong> “So go and make
	followers of all people in the world. Baptize them in the name of
	the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.”</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Acts 7:2 (NLV):</strong> “The God of

	loving-favor from the Lord Jesus Christ. May you have the love of
	God. May you have the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">✋ Story Devotional</h2>
<p>Long ago, a child sat with his grandfather by the fire. He asked,
<em>“Grandpa, what is God really like?”</em></p>
<p>The grandfather smiled and said, <em>“It is like trying to put
together a puzzle. Each piece shows a little part. One verse tells us
something about God here, another shows something more there. When we
put them together, we see the picture: God is Father, Son, and
Spirit.”</em></p>
<p>The boy thought for a while, then said, <em>“So…three Gods?”</em></p>
<p>“No,” the grandfather answered gently. <em>“Only one God.
But He shows Himself in three ways. Just as your name has a first,
middle, and last, yet you are still one person — so God is one,
with three expressions: Father, Son, Spirit.”</em></p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">✨ God in Plain Words</h3>
<p>Jesus told His disciples, <em>“Baptize them in the name of the
Father, Son, and Spirit”</em> (Matt. 28:19). Notice, it says <strong>name</strong>
— not names. God is one, yet fully known in three.</p>
<p>Paul later wrote: <em>“The love of God, the grace of Christ, and
the fellowship of the Spirit be with you”</em> (2 Cor. 13:14). This
is not just teaching. It is our daily experience:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The <strong>Father’s love</strong> is the fountain, the
	beginning.</p></li>
	<li><p>The <strong>Son’s grace</strong> is the river, bringing
	love to us.</p></li>
	<li><p>The <strong>Spirit’s fellowship</strong> is like the water
	we drink, making it real in our hearts.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">✨ God in Stories and Signs</h3>
<p>Jesus also used parables to show us God’s person.</p>
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>The Friend at Midnight</strong> (Luke 11:5-8) — A
	man knocks on his friend’s door at midnight, asking for bread. The
	friend gives it, not because of timing, but because of relationship.
	God is like that — not distant, but close. We pray as a friend
	speaks to a friend.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>The Loving Father</strong> (Luke 15:11-32) — The
	prodigal son wasted everything but finally came home. The father was
	waiting, saw him from far away, and ran to embrace him. God is like
	that Father — eager to welcome, quick to forgive, overflowing with
	love.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">🪞 Application for Us</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>God is not a cold idea but a living Person we can know.</p></li>
	<li><p>When we pray, we come to a <strong>friend</strong> who
	listens.</p></li>
	<li><p>When we sin, we return to a <strong>Father</strong> who runs
	to embrace us.</p></li>
	<li><p>When we live each day, we experience the <strong>Spirit</strong>
	filling us with God’s love and grace.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>👉 Ellen G. White wrote: <em>“Through nature, through the
deepest and tenderest earthly ties, He has sought to reveal Himself
to us. Yet these but imperfectly represent His love”</em> (Steps to
Christ, ch. 1).</p>

<h2 class="western">🙏 Prayer</h2>
<p>“Father, thank You for showing Yourself as Father, Son, and
Spirit. Lord Jesus, thank You for bringing the Father near to me.

Help me walk as Your child, loved and embraced, never far from You.

<p>A young woman once planted a small seed in her garden. She watered
it every morning. Soon, a green sprout appeared, then leaves, then
fruit. She smiled, saying, <em>“This seed is alive. It grows.”</em></p>
<p>But one day, a neighbor came and asked, <em>“Isn’t all life
the same?”</em> She shook her head. <em>“No, only this plant has
the life of its seed. Without the seed, there is no plant.”</em></p>
<p>In the same way, not all life is the same. Human breath is life
for the body, but only <strong>God’s life is eternal life</strong>.
Without the Son, there is no true life (1 John 5:12).</p>
<h3 class="western">✨ <font size="3" style="font-size: 13pt">God’s

<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Life</strong>: God’s life is divine, eternal,
	unchanging. Human life fades, but His life never ends.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Love</strong>: God’s love is not based on what we
	deserve. He loved us while we were fallen (John 3:16; 1 John 4:9).
	His mercy reaches even deeper, pulling us out of sin’s pit (Eph.
	2:4).</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Light</strong>: God is light; no darkness can stay
	with Him (1 John 1:5). One day in eternity, we will need no sun —
	God Himself will shine on us (Rev. 22:5). Even now, His light guides
	us daily.</p></li>

<p><strong>WEEK 4 — THE TRIUNE GOD’S REVELATION AND HIS
ECONOMY</strong><br/>
<strong>DAY 3 — God’s Holiness and
Righteousness</strong></p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">📖 Key Scriptures</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Hebrews 12:10 (NLV):</strong> “Our fathers on earth
	made us suffer for a short time as they thought best. But God makes
	us suffer so we may be holy, as He is holy.”</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Philippians 2:13 (NLV):</strong> “For God is
	working in you. He helps you want to do what pleases Him and gives
	you the power to do it.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">✋ Story Devotional</h2>
<p>One day, a craftsman was melting gold in the fire. As the heat
rose, the impurities floated to the top. He carefully removed them
until the gold shone bright. When asked how he knew the gold was
ready, he said, <em>“When I can see my face in it.”</em></p>
<p>God’s <strong>holiness</strong> is like that pure gold. He sets
us apart from the common and fills us with His own nature. Holiness
is not about being “perfect” by human standards. It means being
different — marked by God’s presence until He sees His own image
in us (Heb. 12:10).</p>
<p>But God is not only holy inside His being — He is also <strong>righteous</strong>
in His actions. Everything He does is fair, true, and just. When we
fail, our conscience may condemn us, but His righteousness does not
change. Because Jesus died and rose again, God’s forgiveness is
always secure (1 John 1:9).</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">✨ Holiness</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>God’s nature is holy — completely different from sin.</p></li>
	<li><p>He shares His holiness with us, shaping our hearts to reflect
	Him.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">✨ Righteousness</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>God’s actions are always just and fair.</p></li>
	<li><p>His throne is built on righteousness (Psalm 89:14).</p></li>
	<li><p>Christ’s blood secures forgiveness; God must forgive when
	we confess.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">🪞 Application for Us</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>When trials come, God is shaping us with His holiness.</p></li>
	<li><p>When we fall, we stand again on the foundation of His
	righteousness.</p></li>
	<li><p>We do not live by our own strength; God is working in us
	(Phil. 2:13).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>👉 Ellen G. White wrote: <em>“Holiness is wholeness for God;
it is the entire surrender of heart and life to the indwelling of the
principles of heaven”</em> (Acts of the Apostles, ch. 5).</p>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">🙏 Prayer</h2>
<p>“Holy God, thank You for calling me to share in Your nature.

<p><strong>WEEK 4 — THE TRIUNE GOD’S REVELATION AND HIS
ECONOMY</strong><br/>
<strong>DAY 4 — God’s Economy: His Plan to
Give Himself</strong></p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">📖 Key Scriptures</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Ephesians 3:9 (NLV):</strong> “I was chosen to make
	clear to all men God’s plan. That plan was hidden in God Who made
	all things from the beginning of the world.”</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>2 Corinthians 13:14 (NLV):</strong> “May you have
	loving-favor from the Lord Jesus Christ. May you have the love of
	God. May you have the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.”</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">✋ Story Devotional</h2>
<p>A wealthy merchant once had great riches. But instead of keeping
them locked away, he made a plan: <em>“I will share my wealth with
as many people as possible.”</em> He arranged workers, markets, and
trade routes so his goods could reach the world.</p>
<p>In the same way, God is the true <strong>Businessman of the
universe</strong>. His riches are not gold or silver — they are
<strong>Himself</strong>. His plan, called <strong>God’s economy</strong>,
is to give Himself to us freely.</p>
<p>The Bible has many teachings, but all point to this: <strong>God’s
heart is to share Himself with people.</strong></p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">✨ What Is God’s Economy?</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>“Economy” means management, arrangement, or stewardship.</p></li>
	<li><p>God’s economy = His plan to <strong>dispense Himself</strong>
	into humanity.</p></li>
	<li><p>His “capital” is Himself. His “product” is Himself.
	His “gift” is Himself.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>💡 <em>Illustration</em>: Think of water flowing through pipes.
The water is God’s life. The pipe system is His plan. Without the
plan, the water would never reach us.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">✨ The Steps of God’s Economy</h3>
<p>How does God reach us? By the <strong>Trinity</strong>:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>The Father</strong> — the source of love.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>The Son</strong> — the expression of that love
	through grace.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>The Spirit</strong> — the transmission that brings
	God into us in fellowship.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Just as electricity has a source, current, and transmission, so
God’s love flows:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>From the Father (source),</p></li>
	<li><p>Through the Son (channel),</p></li>
	<li><p>Into us by the Spirit (connection).</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">🪞 Application for Us</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>God’s plan is not just to give blessings but to give
	<strong>Himself</strong>.</p></li>
	<li><p>Each day we can receive His love, enjoy His grace, and live
	in His fellowship.</p></li>
	<li><p>The more we open to Him, the more His “riches” flow into
	us.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>👉 Ellen G. White wrote: <em>“Through Christ was to be
fulfilled the purpose of Him who from the beginning of the world had
been working out His great plan for the good of man”</em> (Desire
of Ages, ch. 1).</p>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">🙏 Prayer</h2>
<p>“Father, thank You that Your plan is not only to bless me but to
give me <strong>Yourself</strong>. Lord Jesus, thank You for showing
me the grace of God. Holy Spirit, thank You for bringing this love
and grace into my heart daily. Help me to live in Your fellowship.

<p>A boy once asked his teacher, <em>“If God is so great and

<p>The teacher picked up a white cloth and dipped it into blue dye.
She held it up and said, <em>“This is still the same cloth, but now
you can see its new color.”</em></p>
<p>In the same way, the invisible Father became visible in the Son.
Jesus is the “blue-dyed cloth” — God wrapped in humanity.
Through Jesus, we see what God is like.</p>

<h3 class="western">✨ From the Father</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>The <strong>Father</strong> is the source of all things, but
	alone He is unapproachable (1 Tim. 6:16).</p></li>
	<li><p>To draw near to us, He put all His fullness into the <strong>Son</strong>
	(Col. 2:9).</p></li>
	<li><p>Jesus is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15).</p></li>
	<li><p>When we look at Jesus, we see the Father (John 10:30).</p></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">✨ In the Son</h3>
<p>Jesus carries seven “elements” in Himself:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>Divine Nature</strong> — He is fully God.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Incarnation</strong> — He became human, joining
	divinity and humanity.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Human Living</strong> — He experienced hunger,
	thirst, tears, pain, and joy — just like us.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Effective Death</strong> — His death broke sin’s
	power and freed us from Adam’s curse.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Resurrection</strong> — He rose, still a man, with
	eternal resurrection life.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Ascension</strong> — He rose above all powers; all
	things are under His feet.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Enthronement</strong> — He reigns as King of kings,
	seated in glory.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>💡 <em>Illustration</em>: A diamond shines brighter with each

	Christ’s work.</p></li>
	<li><p>Now the Spirit includes: divinity, humanity, human living,
	effective death, resurrection life, ascension power, and
	enthronement glory.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Spirit is <strong>Christ made real to us today</strong>. He is
the “life-giving Spirit” who joins us to God (1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">✨ The Spirit as Reality</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p>Jesus said the Spirit is the Spirit of <strong>truth</strong>,
	which means <strong>reality</strong> (John 15:26).</p></li>
	<li><p>The Spirit makes Jesus more than a story — He makes Him
	alive in our hearts.</p></li>
	<li><p>The Lord <strong>is</strong> the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17) — not
	separate, but fully united.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>💡 <em>Illustration</em>: The sun shines high above, but its
warmth reaches us directly. In the same way, the Spirit is the warmth
of God’s presence filling us every day.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">✨ The Spirit as the All-Inclusive Dose</h3>
<p>Think of modern medicine — one pill with many ingredients: one
to heal, one to strengthen, one to bring peace.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is God’s <strong>all-inclusive dose</strong>. In
one “dose” He brings us:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>God’s life,</p></li>
	<li><p>Christ’s humanity,</p></li>
	<li><p>The power of His death,</p></li>
	<li><p>Resurrection strength,</p></li>
	<li><p>Victory of His ascension,</p></li>
	<li><p>Glory of His throne.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Every day we can “take” this Spirit and find freedom, peace,
and strength.</p>

communicates His life to us. Thus we are born into His family and
fitted for His work”</em> (The Desire of Ages, ch. 52).</p>

</ul>

<h2 class="western">✋ Story Reflection</h2>
<p>At the end of a journey, a traveler looks back over the path. He
remembers the mountains, the valleys, the rivers crossed, and the
friends met along the way. He smiles and says, <em>“Every step was
important — together they made the whole journey.”</em></p>
<p>This week has been like that journey. Each day gave us a piece of
the puzzle. Put together, they show the picture of the <strong>Triune
God — Father, Son, Spirit — giving Himself to us through His
economy.</strong></p>
