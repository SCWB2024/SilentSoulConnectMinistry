THE TRIUNE GOD’S REVELATION AND HIS ECONOMY</h1>
<p><strong>Theme: God’s Big Plan — Giving Himself to Us</strong></p>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">1️👋 God made everything — sky, land,
people.<br/>
But He did not want to stay far away. He wanted to be
close to us.</h2>
<p>God is <strong>One God</strong>, but He shows Himself in <strong>three
ways</strong> — like one light shining in three colors:<br/>
🌞
<strong>Father</strong> – the source, the beginning.<br/>
💧 <strong>Son
(Jesus)</strong> – the way we see and know God.<br/>
🔥 <strong>Spirit
(Holy Spirit)</strong> – the power that lives in us.</p>
<p>God’s plan is simple — He wants to <strong>share Himself</strong>
with us so we can have His <strong>life, love, and light</strong>.</p>
<p>Without Jesus, life is like a <strong>flower cut from the root</strong>
— it looks alive but soon fades.<br/>
With Jesus, life is like a
<strong>tree planted by water</strong> — always growing, always
green.</p>
<p>Jesus came to show us what the Father is like. He lived, died, and
rose again so we can know God for real.<br/>
Now the Holy Spirit
helps us feel God’s love, understand His Word, and live His life
every day.</p>
<p>💡 God’s plan is not just to bless us — it’s to give us
<strong>Himself</strong>.</p>
<hr/>

<h2 class="western">2️ DEVOTIONAL 
</h2>
<p>📖 <strong>Scripture Reading:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Matthew 28:19 — One name: Father, Son, Spirit.</p></li>
	<li><p>John 1:14 — The Word became human.</p></li>
	<li><p>1 Corinthians 15:45 — The last Adam became a life-giving
	Spirit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>✋ <strong>Main Thought:</strong><br/>
God is like the sun 🌞 —</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The <strong>Father</strong> is the sun itself (source).</p></li>
	<li><p>The <strong>Son (Jesus)</strong> is the light we see (the
	image we can understand).</p></li>
	<li><p>The <strong>Spirit</strong> is the warmth we feel (God living
	in us).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>🔥 <strong>God’s Life</strong> — like fire that never burns
out.<br/>
💧 <strong>God’s Love</strong> — like a deep ocean,
wide and endless.<br/>
🌞 <strong>God’s Light</strong> — like
sunrise, chasing away darkness.</p>
<p>When we walk with Him, His <strong>light</strong> shows the right
path, His <strong>love</strong> heals our heart, and His <strong>life</strong>
makes us new.</p>
<p>💬 <strong>Reflection Question:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li><p>How can I feel God close to me today?</p></li>
	<li><p>Where do I see His love shining in my life?</p></li>
	<li><p>What “dark” area can I invite His light into?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>🙏 <strong>Prayer:</strong><br/>
“God, thank You for showing
Yourself as Father, Son, and Spirit. Jesus, thank You for giving Your
life so I can live. Holy Spirit, fill me with Your love and light
today. Amen.”</p>
