  <h2>Our Heart</h2>
  <p>
    Many Deaf and Hard of Hearing individuals are present in faith spaces,
    yet not truly included. Misunderstanding, unclear communication, and
    past experiences of embarrassment or control have caused some to quietly
    withdraw — especially from church life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Silent SoulConnect Ministry exists to change that.
  </p>

  <p>
    We serve the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community through
    <strong>accessible devotionals, prayer, and Bible study</strong>,
    bringing Scripture to life in ways that respect how Deaf individuals
    understand, process, and live out God’s Word.
    SoulStart invites you to rise in faith and rest in grace —
    every day, morning and night.

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    Led by an evangelist and counselor with lived Deaf experience,
    we point to the hope of Christ through
    <strong>clear Scripture, prayer, and practical love</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a space for reflection, restoration, and action —
    where faith is not merely observed,
    but <strong>understood, embraced, and lived</strong>.
