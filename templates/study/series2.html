<h1>Series 2 — From Death to Life</h1>
<p class="muted">Simple, Deaf-friendly flow. Keep eye contact, sign slowly, pause often.</p>
<hr class="soft"/>

<h2>Theme Verse</h2>
<p><strong>Ephesians 2:8–9</strong> — “By grace you have been saved through faith… not by works.”</p>

<h2>Big Idea</h2>
<p>We don’t climb up to God; Jesus comes down to us. Salvation is a gift. We receive it, then live it.</p>

<h2>Outline</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Dead → Alive</strong> (Eph 2:1–5) — God’s mercy makes us alive.</li>
  <li><strong>Grace → Gift</strong> (Eph 2:8–9) — No boasting, only gratitude.</li>
  <li><strong>Workmanship</strong> (Eph 2:10) — Saved for good works, not by them.</li>
  <li><strong>New Identity</strong> (2 Cor 5:17) — New creation, new path.</li>
  <li><strong>Walk It Out</strong> (Col 2:6) — Continue as you began: by faith.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Short Points</h2>
<ul class="bullets">
  <li>Grace starts the story; grace sustains the journey.</li>
  <li>Good works are fruit, not the root.</li>
  <li>Gratitude fuels obedience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reflection Prompts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Where am I still trying to “earn” love from God?</li>
  <li>What one good work this week will flow from gratitude?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
<p>“Jesus, thank You for saving me by grace. Teach me to walk in Your gift every day. Amen.”</p>
